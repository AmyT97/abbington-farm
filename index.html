            The farm shop has a wide range of fresh produce and products, from
            jams and preserves to eggs and bacon. We have free-range eggs that
            are laid by the chickens on our farm. Our cheese is smoked in house,
            giving it a distinctive flavour. Choose from award winning pies with
            fillings such as: apricot or blackberry; hand-made chocolates; local
            honey and marmalade; homemade breads and cakes; locally sourced
            fruit juices, wines, beers and ciders. We also sell fresh vegetables
            grown in our garden!
